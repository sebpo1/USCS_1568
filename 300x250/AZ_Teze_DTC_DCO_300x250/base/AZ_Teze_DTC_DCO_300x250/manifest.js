            <p><span class="caps">WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</span><br/>
            <span class="bold">Hypersensitivity Reactions</span><br>
             Hypersensitivity reactions (eg, rash and allergic conjunctivitis) can<br> 
             occur following administration of TEZSPIRE. These reactions can<br>
             occur within hours of administration, but in some instances have a<br>
             delayed onset (ie, days). In the event of a hypersensitivity reaction,<br> 
             initiate appropriate treatment as clinically indicated  and then consider<br>
             the benefits and risks for the individual patient to determine whether<br> 
             to continue or discontinue treatment with TEZSPIRE.</p>
            
             <p><span class="bold">Acute Asthma Symptoms or Deteriorating Disease</span><br>
             TEZSPIRE should not be used to treat acute asthma symptoms, acute<br> 
             exacerbations, acute bronchospasm, or status asthmaticus.</p>

             <p style="white-space: nowrap"><span class="bold">Abrupt Reduction of Corticosteroid Dosage</span><br>
             Do not discontinue systemic or inhaled corticosteroids abruptly upon<br/>
             initiation of therapy with TEZSPIRE. Reductions in corticosteroid dose, if <br>
             if appropriate, should be gradual and performed under the direct supervision<br>
             of a physician. Reduction in corticosteroid dose may be associated with<br>
             systemic withdrawal symptoms and/or unmask conditions previously<br>
             suppressed by systemic corticosteroid therapy.
            </p>
             <span class="bold">Parasitic (Helminth) Infection</span>
             <p style="white-space: nowrap">
             It is unknown if TEZSPIRE will influence a patient’s response against <br/>
             helminth infections. Treat patients with pre-existing helminth infections <br>
             before initiating therapy with TEZSPIRE. If patients become infected while<br>
             receiving TEZSPIRE and do not respond to anti-helminth treatment,<br>
             discontinue TEZSPIRE until infection resolves.<br>
            </p>
            
             <span class="bold">Live Attenuated Vaccines </span>
             <p style="white-space: nowrap">
             The concomitant use of TEZSPIRE and live attenuated vaccines has not  <br/>
             been evaluated. The use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided in  <br>
             patients receiving TEZSPIRE.<br>
            </p>
            
             <p>
             <span class="caps">ADVERSE REACTIONS </span><br>
             The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥3%) are pharyngitis,<br>
             arthralgia, and back pain<br>
             
             </p>
             
             <p style="white-space: nowrap">
             <span class="caps">USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS  </span><br>
             There are no available data on TEZSPIRE use in pregnant women to<br>
             evaluate for any drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage,<br>
             or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Placental transfer of<br> 
             monoclonal antibodies such as tezepelumab-ekko is greater during the third <br>
             trimester of pregnancy; therefore, potential effects on a fetus are likely to <br>
             be greater during the third trimester of pregnancy.<br>
             </p>

             <span class="caps">INDICATION </span><br>
             TEZSPIRE is indicated for the add-on maintenance treatment of adult and <br>
             pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with severe asthma.<br>
             TEZSPIRE is not indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm or status <br> 
             asthmaticus. <br>
